V1 - The purpose of CrashSimulator is to expose faults in applications that result from an incomplete understanding of
common APIs used by the application.

V2 (from Lois) - “Robust applications must run in a number of different environments and over multiple platforms. By
identifying the weaknesses in a program that may not be obvious on its ‘native” platform, but could manifest themselves
when run over a more complex network, CrashSimulator can help designers anticipate and adjust programs by providing
automated identification of environment-induced faults”
