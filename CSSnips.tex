%  -- What do you mean by environments?  Are you trying to detect bugs that would occur if an application was run on a different operating system?  The same operating system (Windows, Linux, etc) but different release?  Different kinds of filesystems (USB vs NTFS vs NFS?)?  *This is important: the reader needs to know extremely soon how big a problem we're tackling!*

For the purposes of this work an application's environment consists of two sets of entities.  The first is the
application's software dependencies on a given system.  For example, multiplatform applications intended for Unix-like
environments typically depend on a POSIX implementation to operate on both Linux and Apple's OS X.  The second set is
resources the application interacts with for the purposes of gathering the data it needs for processing.  Examples
include files on a filesystem from which the application needs to read or hosts on a network with which the application
exchanges data.
