TODO: Write out simple example traces
TODO: Need Trace-Repeater of some sort
    TODO: Trace-Repeater: Non-Race conditions -> probably make calls in the same order anyway
    TODO: Trace-Repeater: Might be an off the shelf tool for replaying traces
TODO: Write about how this can be a general technique but this paper focuses on network faults as those are what we
chose to implement
TODO: Decide whether or not to include the detailed information about how Firefox and apache were scripted
TODO: Look at the bugs that were identified in the NetCheck and CheckAPI papers
TODO: Look into related work for NetCheck, CheckAPI
TODO: Look at Christmas Tree TCP Checks
What about feeding already tainted traces back into CrashSimulator
    The "all possible bugs" example
    Is it then easier to permute through this very broken text
TODO: traces come from unit tests. What happens if we permute the unit tests from which the pristine test was taken
    One trace per test
TODO: Look into the Apache portable runtime
TODO: Make a better working title
TODO: Discuss the fact that the NetCheck component can be run once and then CrashSimulator repeatedly
TODO: Make the font in the figure bigger but fit the figure into the same space as much as possible
TODO: Use shading rather than colored highlights
TODO: Choose colors that are easier to see
TODO: Don't use colored text
TODO: Make the figure fit the width of the paper
TODO: One or two sentences for the caption -- Look at other papers
TODO: Describe the figure in the text
TODO: Use real world applications and environments in the diagram
TODO: Split into two processes: Generating anomalies with NetCheck, repeatedly testing off the generated corpus of
anomalies
TODO: Make the corpus of anomalies an entity in the diagram
TODO: Make an entity for the application under test. It feeds into test runner along with mutated traces.
TODO: Test runner's output is the report
TODO: Add a definitions section to the background and motivation section
TODO: Convey the fact that there can be hundreds of mutated traces
TODO: Thesis: "Only manifest themselves in the target environment"
TODO: Use the python running example
TODO: Use this as an entity in the diagram
TODO: Include a mutated trace with the EWOULDBLOCK issue
TODO: Talk about other bug reports that were related to this issue
