\section{Evaluation}

    \subsection{Bugs Identified}

    %% Intro paragraph
    First, CrashSimulator was evaluated against NUMBER of popular tools with public bug trackers available. The goal was
    to identify bugs from each tool's bug tracker (both fixed and unfixed) that are related to the faults that
    CrashSimulator can inject. Next, CrashSimulator was run against these tools fault counts were collected. A
    comparison of the number of faults identified by the tool's users in the tool's bug tracker to the number of faults
    identified by CrashSimulator is presented in the table below.
