  It is common that an application that is tested extensively, still has a 
  large numbers of bugs manifest when deployed in production.  This is because
  it is not feasible to test all of an application's potential 
  \emph{environments}.  These environmental differences, such as slightly 
  different behavior due to different OS versions, file systems, network
  middleboxes, etc. often manifest themselves as failures or crashes of the
  application. 
%  will be used 
%  A major problem when introducing new applications is that
%  the environment
%  into which an application is introduced can be a source of flaws that remain
%  hidden until after a costly deployment.
  CrashSimulator is a technique and tool that uses information about how 
  different environments differ to identify incorrect application behavior 
  caused by unhandled anomalous environmental conditions before the 
  application is deployed.  
%such as
%  differing API behavior, network performance, or filesystem state.
  The tool replays system call traces recorded from the application under
  test as a means to monitor and control execution. During replay,
  CrashSimulator modifies system call return values and program states to
  simulate an anomalous environment. Next, a checker determines whether the
  application is responding to the anomaly appropriately. This process allows
  CrashSimulator to use incorrect behavior identified in one application running
  in one environment to determine whether other applications
  would make the same mistake in that environment. By testing an
  application against a series of these test cases, CrashSimulator 
  lets the developer see how the application would respond if executed in
  a similar environment.
  We evaluated CrashSimulator by using it to test a set of the most popular 
  Linux applications, including vim, nano, aspell, and others selected from 
  the Coreutils project and the Debian popularity contest. The result of this 
  evaluation was 84 bugs identified in 31 applications with consequences 
  ranging from hangs and crashes to data loss and remote denial of service 
  conditions.
  %All but one of the bugs identified by CrashSimulator were previously unknown.
  %One was independently identified and reported to Python's bug tracker.
