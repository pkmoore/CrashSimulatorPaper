    One of the challenges of software development is anticipating and dealing with the variety of environments in which
    an application may run. For example, an application may work correctly on the developer's low latency, local network
    but fail when it communicates across a node that performs network address translation or a link that introduces high
    latency into network communications. These types of failures are difficult anticipate and test for without deploying
    the application to the each target environment. This paper introduces CrashSimulator, a tool designed to determine
    whether or not an application can handle these, and other, unanticipated conditions during the development process,
    saving the developer the effort of testing the application in each of its intended environments. CrashSimulator
    accomplishes this in two phases. First, its anomaly identification tools analyze system call traces with the purpose
    of identifying irregular (or unusual) behaviors. These anomalies are collected and stored for later use during the
    testing phase. In this phase, they are used to mutate a system call trace taken from the application under test when
    it was running under normal circumstances with the goal of introducing into it one or more of the anomalous
    behaviors identified previously. Once a set of mutated traces has been generated the application under test is run
    repeatedly with each run replaying one of the mutated traces. These test runs are monitored and any faults in the
    application are reported. As a result, the developer is made aware of deficiencies in the application that may
    result in it operating incorrectly in the environment from which the anomalous traces were taken. This allows the
    application to be tested as if it were running in one or more of the environments from which anomalous traces were
    collected.  CrashSimulator was used to analyze \emph{<<somenumber>>} commonly used open and closed source
    applications.  Its findings were compared to tickets listed in the bug tracking suites of these applications.  It
    was able to successfully identify \emph{<<somenumber>>} of bugs listed in these suites and
    \emph{<<someothernumber>>} of bugs that had not yet been discovered.
