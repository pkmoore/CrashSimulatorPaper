  One of the challenges of software development is anticipating and dealing with the variety of environments in which an
  application may run.  This work introduces CrashSimulator, a tool that identifies incorrect application behavior that
  arises as a result of unhandled environmental conditions.  CrashSimulator replays system call traces recorded from the
  application under test as a means to monitor and control execution.  During these replay executions, CrashSimulator
  classifies application behavior as either correct or incorrect based on computational models that encode system call
  sequences indicative of bad behavior. This process allows CrashSimulator to use incorrect behavior identified in one
  application running in one environment as a ``test case'' that determines whether another application in a different
  environment is making the same mistake.  By testing an application against a series of these ``test cases'',
  CrashSimulator is able to give an application's developers an idea of how the application will respond were it to be
  deployed and executed in the environment from which the ``test cases'' were generated.''
