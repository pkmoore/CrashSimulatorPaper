% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf{}
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

    One of the challenges of software development is anticipating and dealing with the differences in the variety of
    environments in which an application may run. For example, an application may work correctly on the developer's low
    latency, local network but fail when run across a node that performs network address translation or across a link
    that introduces high latency into network communications. This paper introduces CrashSimulator, a tool designed to
    induce crashes in applications that do not properly handle these unanticipated conditions.  CrashSimulator
    accomplishes this in three steps. First, it analyzes a system call trace of an application collected using a utility
    like \emph{strace} in order to identify a set of system calls that are commonly mishandled by developers. Next, it
    injects faults into the running application at the previously identified points by using \emph{ptrace}. Finally, it
    observes whether or not the application continued to operate normally after the encountering the error and reports
    its findings to the developer. As a result, the developer is made aware of deficiencies in the application without
    having to go through a potentially complex and costly deployment or beta test scenario. Because CrashSimulator
    operates using black-box analysis utilities it does not require access to an application's source code.
    CrashSimulator was used to analyze \emph{<<somenumber>>} commonly used open and closed source applications.  Its
    findings were compared to tickets listed in the bug tracking suites of these applications.  It was able to
    successfully identify \emph{<<somenumber>>} of bugs listed in these suites and \emph{<<someothernumber>>} of bugs
    that had not yet been discovered.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart

    One major hurdle in developing robust applications is anticipating and dealing with edge conditions and faults that
    compromise and applications ability to run as intended. A common source of faults is the environment in which an
    application runs. The typical approach to eliminating faults in an application is the creation of a suite of tests that
    exercise the applications functionality and ensure that it always acts appropriately. In the case of issues that arise
    from an application's environment it is not possible to enumerate and test for an acceptable amount of faults due to the
    variety of hardware and software systems that make up the environment.

    This problem is of particular concern in the context of today's highly network dependent applications. With the
    explosion of mobile computing and software as a service products applications that are completely reliant on
    well-behaved network communication are increasingly common. As a result a great deal of emphasis must be placed on
    properly dealing with faults in these network communications. Unfortunately, identifying these faults is difficult due
    to the inability of the developer to replicate all possible application environments and exhaust all possible code
    paths.

    Existing white-box testing tools like DART and SAGE testing tools rely on static analysis and symbolic execution of
    code in order to determine sets of inputs that exercise particular code paths. DART symbolically executes an
    applications source code in order to facilitate its testing. This limits DART to operating only on programs written
    in C. SAGE improves on this strategy symbolically executing an application's x86 machine code instructions but this
    results in an architecture based rather than programming language based limitation. CrashSimulator avoids these
    issues by relying on transparent observation of native execution of an application.

    %% Does this need to be here? Am I just arguing against static analysis???
    Symbolic execution is computationally expensive and can result in deviations where the symbolic execution of code
    Doesn't accurately represent the actual execution of code.
    %% Is this a true sentence??
    Both tools focus on how the application under test behaves when given a particular set of inputs without taking the
    program's environment into account. DART assumes that external functions are side effect free (I.e.\ their execution
    does not modify program memory). Alternatively, CrashSimulator executes standard, non-instrumented versions of an
    application and transparently injects faults via the programs interaction with the environment in which it is
    running through system calls.

    %%% Need examples of black-box testing tools
    The alternative, black-box tools, have their own set of issues. They do not have an understanding of what an
    application is actually doing during execution which means they are only able to submit inputs and observe outputs.
    They cannot identify specifically the source of faults in an application.

    In light of these shortcomings, an alternative approach is needed to provide developers with confidence that their
    applications are sufficiently free of environment induced faults.  CrashSimulator is a tool designed to meet this
    need by providing automated identification of environment-induced faults through simulated deviations from the
    normal flow of system calls an application makes to interact with its environment.

    CrashSimulator is able to test applications in a completely black-box manner. It utilizes system call traces
    collected during execution of the program to identify points for fault injection and injects the faults on
    subsequent runs using ptrace to hook the applications execution and access its memory and registers. It then
    evaluates whether the program successfully handled the injected fault or not and reports these results to the
    developer.

\section{Background and Motivation}

    %%This sentence is very similar to the one from the Sniper paper
    This section describes the techniques and terminologies used in other automatic testing frameworks.

    \textbf{Black-box vs White-box Testing:} There are two primary approaches to automated software testing: black-box
    testing and white-box testing. White-box testing tools require access to an applications source code in order to test
    it. Typically this means that the testing tool is able to better ``understand'' the application. This can result in more
    efficient and targeted testing. In the case of DART, the applications source code is used to generate a ``test
    interface'' for each of the functions that make up the application. SAGE takes a slightly different approach in that it
    works with compiled application code rather than source code. Its testing still falls into the white-box category
    because of the way it attempts interpret and reason about the application's machine code.

    Black-box tools work only by manipulating inputs into the application and observing outputs. Because they do not
    attempt to understand the internal workings of an application, these tools are typically less complex from an
    implementation and runtime standpoint. The price of this lack of complexity is reduced the inability to target
    specific code paths or identify where faults come from.

    \textbf{System Call Trace Analysis:} CrashSimulator is based on prior work from two projects: NetCheck and
    CheckAPI.\@  It, like these tools, analyzes system call traces captured from an execution of the application under
    test in order to determine locations that are likely to to be sources of faults. These traces are captured using
    strace and dtrace, the standard tools made available for this purpose in Linux and OS X respectively. Each system
    call is evaluated within the context of prior system calls, their parameters, and return values. This system call
    context is compared an ideal model and deviations from this model are logged.

    \textbf{Crash Simulation:} Once CrashSimulator has generated a series of potential faults from its analysis of an
    application's system call trace the process of verifying the presence of faults can begin. Verification handled by
    running an instance of the application and injecting one of the potential faults identified during the analysis
    step.  The results of this faulty execution are monitored and any deviations in output from the ``correct'' output
    are recorded. Faults that result in an application crashing are also recorded.

% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
