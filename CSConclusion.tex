\section{Conclusion}

Many post-deployment failures result from
unexpected interactions between an application and its environment.
Although finding and eliminating faults in applications is a key concern for software developers, it is impractical for them to test an application in all of the
environments in which it will be deployed.
 To address this
problem, this work presented CrashSimulator, a testing
approach that utilizes mutation, replay, and analysis of system call traces
in order to test whether applications respond correctly to 
anamolous environment conditions.
A significant benefit of CrashSimulator is that failures observed
in executing one application in an anomolous environment can
easily be leveraged to test whether {\em other} applications
suffer from the same underlying problem.

CrashSimulator's key features, operating on system calls and analysis of replayed executions allow it to identify bugs
resulting from an application's interactions with its environment.
%Performing its analysis on a replayed execution of an application allows
%CrashSimulator to remove the filesystem and network dependancies of the application under test.  
To test whether an application responds appropriately to a particular
anomaly (such as an unexpected filetype, an unexpected device, an unexpected
network conditions, etc.)
CrashSimulator records system call traces from the application under test,
mutates return values and/or program state to simulate execution in 
the anomalous environment, and invokes a checker to see whether
subsequent system calls indicate a correct or incorrect response.
This allows
CrashSimulator to test an application running in one environment
as if it were running in another environment. 
%Additionally,
%it provides an interface for CrashSimulator to manipulate the execution in order to direct an application down
%testing-relevant code paths.  
%Finally, view of execution that can be consumed by computational models that can classify

%whether or not an application has behaved correctly in some situation.

CrashSimulator evaluates application behavior in the (simulated) anomalous environment
by analyzing system call traces using
finite state models characterizing correct (or incorrect) behavior.
This provides a generic ``signature'' for that behavior, which is
portable across applications. 
Consequently, a set, of mutations and checkers can be collected from any existing
application for use in testing other new or existing application. 
In this way, an ever-expanding ``test suite'' can
be created allowing lessons learned from a bug in one application to benefit others.

Our evaluation of CrashSimulator has shown it to be both performant and
effective.  CrashSimulator was able to identify bugs related to unusual file
types in 15 applications and bugs related to slow network performance in 10
network applications and libraries.  Additionally CrashSimulator found
filesystem related bugs in 7 applications and libraries with facilities for
moving files between areas of a system's filesystem.  The low overhead
introduced by CrashSimulator's technique meant that it was able to
find these bugs quickly in spite of its unoptomized implementation.

Future work will include expanding the repository of anomalies and their checkers, as well as exploring opportunities to further automate the discovery of anomalies and checkers.
