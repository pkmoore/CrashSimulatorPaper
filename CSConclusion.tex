\section{Conclusion}

Minimizing the number of faults present in the applications they write is a key concern for software developers.  An
under-represented source of faults are the interactions between an application and its environment.  To combat this
problem, this work presented CrashSimulator, a tool that utilizes replay of system call traces in order to facilitate the
injection of environment-based faults into the application for testing purposes.

CrashSimulator's key features, operating on system calls and analysis of replayed executions allow it to identify bugs
that fall outside of the application itself.  Performing its analysis on a replayed execution of an application allows
CrashSimulator to remove the filesystem and network dependancies of the application under test.  This means
CrashSimulator can execute and test an application on one system as if it were running on another system.  Additionally,
it provides an interface for CrashSimulator to manipulate the execution in order to direct an application down
testing-relevant code paths.  Finally, view of execution that can be consumed by computational models that can classify
whether or not an application has behaved correctly in some situation.

Encoding bad behavior as computational models provides a generic ``signature'' for that behavior.  This signature is
portable across applications.  This means that a set, or suite, of signatures can be collected from any existing
application for use in testing any other new or existing application.  In this way, an ever-expanding ``test suite'' can
be created allowing learnings from one application to benefit others.

We have shown CrashSimulator's approach to be successful by identifying bugs, both previously known and unknown, in
existing popular applications.  These bugs were identified using knowledge gained from how one application correctly
performs a particular operation (namely, copying a file across disks) by encoding that knowledge as computational models
and allowing these models to analyze replayed executions of the other listed applications.
